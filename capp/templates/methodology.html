    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      As part of the class Green Digitalization and App Developement,
      our team has created an app to mitigate the carbon footprint within the transportation sector.
      We will here give an overview of our calculations that are included in the app.
      We have also included an example option, where it gives you an alternative way of tranportation and it shows how much you can save from it.
      We hope this can help you, and help others make more enviromental conscious travel decisions.
