    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p>
      In our Green Digitalization and App Development course, our team developed an application aimed at reducing the carbon footprint associated with transportation. This presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the calculations embedded within the app. Additionally, we will demonstrate a feature that suggests alternative transportation methods and quantifies potential carbon savings.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to empower users to make more environmentally conscious travel choices, contributing positively to our planet's health.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <section class="strategy-column left">
      <h1> What are CO2 equivalents?</h1>
      <p>Different greenhouse gasses, have different global warming potentials. Instead of saying to the user that they are emitting methane, nitrous oxide and CO2 - we add up the global warming potential of all the emissions, and present CO2 equivalents instead. </p>
      <p>This way, it is easier for the user to compare different means of transportation, to ultimately choose the best alternative for their journey. .</p>
    </section>
    <section class="strategy-column right">
      <h1>How we aim to help users</h1>
      <p>We aim to measure the carbon emissions from people's transportation choices, guiding them to recognize their positive habits and identify those that could be altered. This approach is designed to inspire individuals to play a role in shaping a more sustainable future.</p>
      <p>To help them become actors of a greener world, we display the expected carbon footprint of their journey, as well as giving them suggestions on how to travel more environmentally friendly.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="strategy-column left">
      <h1>The Calculation</h1>
      <p>We take the user kilometer input data and multiply by the emission constants shown in the graph to the right, to produce the output of total CO2-eq emissions for the application user. This formula is displayed below.</p>
      <p class="formula-mathjax">
        \[ \text{Total CO}_2\text{-eq emitted per passenger} = \text{Emission constant} \times \text{km traveled} \]
      </p>
      <p>Depending on the user's travel distance and transportation type, we provide suggestions for the user to travel more environmentally friendly. This is calculated by subtracting the users choiceâ€™ with our suggestions. Formula is displayed below.</p>
      <p class="formula-mathjax">
        \[ \text{g CO}_2\text{-eq saved} = \text{g CO}_2\text{-eq users choice} - \text{g CO}_2\text{-eq our suggestion} \]
      </p>
      <p> If you are interested in learning about more of our formulas and data foundation, an extensive explanation is available in the Methodology paper</p>

    <section class="strategy-column right">
      <h1>The Data</h1>
      <p>This graph aims to show the CO2 equivielent of different means of transportation we have used in our App</p>
      <img src="static/images/graph.png" alt="";>
      <p>The full explanation, data foundation and calculations for the data shown in the graph, including the Data Table, is available in the Methodology paper.</p>
